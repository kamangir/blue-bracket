# blue bracket

## for machine vision on raspberry pi and jetson nano

machine vision on the edge requires a motherboard, a camera, and a few other peripherals - environmental sensors, a UPS to provide power, and screens and other display units to communicate w/ the user, are also great to have.

here are [six designs](designs) for this purpose - each yields a modern Linux machine that is connected to a camera and can run almost anything Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and much more - the motherboard is either a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson Nano - the rest of the hardware is picked accordingly.

for each design a bom is provided - each design uses two or more variants of the `blue bracket` - `stl`/`obj` files for the brackets plus gcode for PLA in low quality (0.3 mm) for [DigiLab 3D Printer 3D45](https://3pitech.com/products/dremel-digilab-3d45-3d-printer) are [included in this repo](brackets).
