# Blue Bracket

## For machine vision & ai on raspberry pi and jetson nano on the edge.

Machine vision on the edge requires a motherboard, a camera, and a few other peripherals. Environmental sensors, a UPS to provide power, and screens and other display units to communicate w/ the user, are also great to have.

Here are [nine designs](designs) for this purpose. Each yields a modern Linux machine that is connected to a camera and can run almost anything Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and much more. The motherboard is either a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson Nano. The rest of the hardware is picked accordingly. Click on the images to see more.

For each design a bom is provided.

Each design uses two or more variants of the `blue bracket`. `stl`/`obj`/`skp` (SketchUp 2022) files for the brackets plus gcode for PLA in low quality (0.3 mm) for [DigiLab 3D Printer 3D45](https://3pitech.com/products/dremel-digilab-3d45-3d-printer) are [included in this repo](brackets).
